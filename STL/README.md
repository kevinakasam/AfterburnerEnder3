### How to print?
All parts can be printed without support (except x_motor_housing.stl; see below) and are already in the optimal orientation for printing. All Afterburner parts should be printed out of Abs(+). I'm using Esun ABS(+), this is very easy tp print. But remember that the fumes are toxic, so use an enclosure and an air filter (spoiler: I'm going to release a very powerful fan soon). I added a small support structure to the afterburner_carraige.stl. just break it after printing (see red surface below).

I'm using Gregs Modulaar Fan Duct and 5015 Mod (https://github.com/Greg191134/Voron/tree/master/Afterburner%20Optimisation). I had a small gap between the extruder and tool part, so I moved the mounting holes 1mm up (see afterburner_carriage_5015mod.stl). Since I never tested the stock Afterburner, I don't know if this "error" also occurs with the normal Afterburner or only with Greg's mod. Feel free to give me feedback.

1: Add support to the upper chain mount        |  2: break the small bridge (red surface)
