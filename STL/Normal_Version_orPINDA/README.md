Carriage to mount the Afterburner to your Ender 3. Option to integrate the limit switch and add a PINDA. If you want to use a BL-Touch check the other version.

### How to print?
All parts can be printed without support and are already in the optimal orientation for printing.
I added a small support structure to the afterburner_carraige.stl (see red surface below). There's also some support in the end of the belt clamp. Just break both after printing.

I'm using Gregs Modulaar Fan Duct and 5015 Mod (https://github.com/Greg191134/Voron/tree/master/Afterburner%20Optimisation). I had a small gap between the extruder and tool part, so I moved the mounting holes 1mm up (see afterburner_carriage_5015mod.stl). Since I never tested the stock Afterburner, I don't know if this "error" also occurs with the normal Afterburner or only with Greg's mod. Feel free to give me feedback.
